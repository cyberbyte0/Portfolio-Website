# Fareed Akram — Portfolio

This is a lightweight multi-page portfolio (HTML/CSS/JS) designed to be hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Quick start

1. Create a new GitHub repository (public).
2. Upload the files:
   - `index.html`, `experience.html`, `skills.html`, `projects.html`, `contact.html`
   - `styles.css`, `script.js`
   - `assets/avatar.jpg` (replace with your photo)
3. In the repo settings -> Pages:
   - Choose branch `main` (or `master`) and folder `/root`
   - Save — the site will be published at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`
4. Replace links inside the site (GitHub, LinkedIn, email) with your final profile if needed.

## Customize
- Replace `assets/avatar.jpg` with your profile picture.
- Update content in HTML pages with additional projects, blog links, or certificates.
- To add blog posts, create a `/blog/` folder with HTML posts and a blog index.

## Notes
- The site respects system dark mode by default; users can toggle and their preference is stored locally.
- All JS is vanilla; no build step required.
